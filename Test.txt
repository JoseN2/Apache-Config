The goal of our project was to create a Python script that could make or suggest changes to Apache Web Servers to configure them for best practice security standards or recommend changes to fit those standards. Our Script is able to work across Linux and Windows systems and is compatible with Apache 2.4 and 2.2 frameworks.
