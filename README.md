The goal of the project was to create a Python script that could make/suggest changes to Apache Web Servers to configure them for best practice security standards or recommend changes to fit those standards. 
The script is able to work across Linux and Windows systems and is compatible with Apache 2.4 and 2.2 frameworks.
